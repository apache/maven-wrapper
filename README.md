You have found a bug, or you have an idea for a cool new feature? Contributing
code is a great way to give something back to the open source community. Before
you dig right into the code, there are a few guidelines that we need
contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of
things.

Getting Started
---------------

+ Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
+ If you're planning to implement a new feature, it makes sense to discuss your changes
  on the [dev list][ml-list] first.
  This way you can make sure you're not wasting your time on something that isn't
  considered to be in Apache Maven's scope.
+ Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  + Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  + Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
+ Fork the repository on GitHub.

Making and Submitting Changes
--------------

We accept Pull Requests via GitHub. The [developer mailing list][ml-list] is the
main channel of communication for contributors.
There are some guidelines which will make applying PRs easier for us:
+ Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (this is usually the master branch).
  Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
+ Make commits of logical units.
+ Respect the original code style: by using the same [codestyle][code-style],
  patches should only highlight the actual difference, not being disturbed by any formatting issues:
  + Only use spaces for indentation.
  + Create minimal diffs - disable on save actions like reformat source code or organize imports.
    If you feel the source code should be reformatted, create a separate PR for this change.
  + Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
+ Make sure you have added the necessary tests (JUnit/IT) for your changes.
+ Run all the tests with `mvn -Prun-its verify` to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
+ Submit a pull request to the repository in the Apache organization.

If you plan to contribute on a regular basis, please consider filing a [contributor license agreement][cla].

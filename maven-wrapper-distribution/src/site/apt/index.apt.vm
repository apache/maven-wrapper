 ${project.description}

 Distributions types share the same base structure:

----
mvnw
mvnw.cmd
.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties
----

 but every distribution has specific content to manage different strategies to get {{{../maven-wrapper/}<<<maven-wrapper.jar>>>}}:

 - <<<only-script>>>: the new lite implementation of <<<mvnw>>>/<<<mvnw.cmd>>> scripts will download the maven directly with <<<wget>>> or <<<curl>>> on *nix, or PowerShell on Windows, then exec/call the original <<<mvn>>>/<<<mvn.cmd>>> scripts of the downloaded maven distribution, skipping <<<maven-wrapper.jar>>>.
 
 - <<<script>>>: <<<mvnw>>>/<<<mvnw.cmd>>> scripts will download {{{../maven-wrapper/}<<<maven-wrapper.jar>>>}} with <<<wget>>> or <<<curl>>> on *nix, or PowerShell on Windows
 
 - <<<bin>>> (default): no need to download <<<maven-wrapper.jar>>> binary, it is directly provided and used from project source tree (if stored in source control):

----
.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar
----

 - <<<source>>>: on *nix, if <<<wget>>> and <<<curl>>> are not available, <<<mvnw>>> script will compile <<<MavenWrapperDownloader.java>>> source then run the class to download {{{../maven-wrapper/}<<<maven-wrapper.jar>>>}}:

----
.mvn/wrapper/MavenWrapperDownloader.java
----

 []

 Distribution can be installed in a project either by unpacking zip archive by hand, or by using {{{../maven-wrapper-plugin/}<<<wrapper:wrapper>>>}}.
